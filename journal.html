	Lila's Journal 
</h1></center>

<h1>
	9.14.23 #1</h1>
	<p>
	Learning how to apply different fonts. Make sure to copy the link and the css and dont forget to add the body font family thing within a style tage. For a header use h then add numbers for paragraphs just use a p. For the website I want to have ducks and then a single chicken (for the journal) walking across the screen and someone has to tap on one for either the project or the journal entries. Other in the next class I need to learn about placement and and how to make the divs move across the screen. 
</p>

<h1>9.21.23 #2</h1>
<p>This is the second journal. THIS WILL SAVE WHAT I DO ON THIS CODE AND PUT IT ONTO THE ACTUAL WEBSITE. IF I DONT IT WONT SHOW. Learning how to save the code onto github. Go to terminal. use ls *lists things in folder* to get into the files use cd ./ to get into a folder ../ means go up ./ go down. 
</p>

<h1>ALWAYS DO THIS AFTER I'M DONE CODING FOR THE DAY</h1>
<p>
	go git status *what did i change --- if green means already added --- if red its changed but not yet added* -> git add . *adds all the changes* -> git commit -m "changes made" -> git push *publishes your website*
</p>

<h1>10.12.23 #3</h1>
<p>Learned about console.log - a form of java script - learning mouseclick , click , keypress </p>

<h1>10.26.23 #4</h1>
<p> documuent . eventListener (after the period the first word is lowercased then the second word is uppercased) eventListener is a function in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur then responds to it. Learned how to make a specfic key when pressed do a specific fucntion such as the up arrow makes the div move up and vice versa for the down arrow. Also adding audio make sure it is an mp3 or m4a look back in jumpscare project for reference.  </p>

<h1>11.2.23 #5</h1>
<p> Making thank you gift and finally finished the jumpscare. Not much of a jumpscare but more learning how to use specfic keys are special movements. </p>

<h1>11.9.23 #6</h1>
<p> Made a my first gift for my friend. I made a music player that every time you click there is a random song and a random image of kpop idols. I need to add more images and songs to the gift, make it look more like a music player and then make sure that the font shows korean letters rather than english. </p>

<h1>11.14.23 #7</h1>
<p> Functions ()mean input and the {} are outputs. Give the function a name such as add4 then in the input give it a name because it is a placeholder. Then in the console log say placeholder + whatever you want to add to the function. then outside of the curly brackets say the name of the function plus what you want the +4 to be added to. If it add4("lila") then in the console log it would say lila 4 but it i gave it a number it would add 4 to whatever number it was.  </p>

<h1>11.29.23 #8</h1>
<p> We are able to use ChatGPT as a tutor to teach us stuff that we dont understand when we search it up or just stuck. Go there if im are stuck or if I cant get in touch with Molly. I also learned what appendChild mean. ChatGPT explained it as putting a new toy into your toy box. The toy box is the html doc and the toy is your elements </p>

<h1>12.19.23 #9</h1>
<p> This is my last journal entry for 2023. I learned so many new things about comp sci this year. My two latest projects, the one with the duck and cat. You are able to put hats or different accessories on them. This is through a special code using appendChild and other functions. Although I am using this code I am not able to explain it to someone yet. (dont tell Molly, I just copied and pasted it from my other projects >-<) I am still working out the little bugs in the code but they are both about done! </p>

<h1>1.09.24 #10</h1>
<p> We learned how to make an array. Need to make "var" name it then create a list of whatever you on the inside I used the abreviations of all my kpop groups i mostly listen. It was the first thing that came to mind. After you need to make math random and math round. Math random creates random numbers which are all in decimal form them math round rounds it to whole numbers. After that you have to connect it to the list you made by using [] brackets which connects it. After you need to make a event listner so that when you click it randomly changes yay.  </p>

<h1>1.23.24 #10</h1>
<p> When making an array, having multiple photos or names or phrases. Make sure that you have the proper amount of math random things because if not when you click there will be an "undefined" object which messes up the randomness of the phrases like i had during my Valentines day array. I had my cat, nico, choose your fortune for 2024 valentines day. No one will know unless they look at the source inspect or this jounral that 10 out of 13 phrases are negative, only the luckiest of the luckiest will have a get a yes. >u<  </p>

<h1>2.15.24 #11</h1>
<p> Learned how to make a slideshow using the revealjs code that has been premade. What I added was the cat fortune teller, slideshow, and a heart clicker. The heart clicker was really straight foward. All I needed was an input to show that when you clicked a heart away it would appear in the input. I also added an array so that they would be created at different times and in random spots. It was a really fun project. Lastly, we learned how to make a caluclator/check the percentage using mathround and mathrandom.  </p>

<h1>2.22.24 #12</h1>
<p> In the new project, we learned how use the rgb in sublime text. RGB is red green and blue which is used to create all colors on the screen. Because there are three colors we had to make variables for each color allowing us to put them intro a string. A variable is its own thing and when you put mulitple words or in our case variables it created a string. The quotation marks are used to represent a string and plus signs help convert the variable to a number.  </p>

<h1>4.16.24 #12</h1>
<p> In class we are working on our final projects. For mine I am making a game similar to the snake game on goodle. I am doing this because of my friends in middle school and they were all obsessed with the game. My first step was the to make the game in scratch. It works but not I have to put into sublime text. To start the code I have to make the grid, snake, and food. Then make the snake move around the screen while adding another piece to it to make it longer. Then have the food move around randomly,   </p>
